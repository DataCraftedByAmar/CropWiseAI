# Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Description
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning application that recommends suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions. It assists farmers in making informed crop choices to enhance yield and profitability by analyzing factors like soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels.

## Key Features

- **Input Data Collection**: Users can input soil parameters, climate details, and location.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Manages missing values and normalizes features for optimal model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM for predictions.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains on historical data to ensure accurate recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for data input and viewing recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend development and model training.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks.
- **Flask**: For the web interface.
- **HTML/CSS & JavaScript**: For user interface design and interactions.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation-system.git
   cd crop-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Weather Integration**: To refine recommendations based on current conditions.
- **Market Price Analysis**: To assist in economically viable crop decisions.
- **Mobile App Development**: For easier access on mobile devices.
- **User Feedback Mechanism**: To continuously improve recommendations.
